# Soccer-Training-App

## Motive
This reason behind this app is a simple one; I've played soccer since the age of five. I come from a family of athletes. My closest friends are people I've met on the pitch. After everything soccer has given me, I realized it's time for me to give back. I have a lot of experience to offer so this is is my attempt to, through combining two of my passions which are tech and soccer, bring soccer training to the next level!

This is just the beginning...
